1/21/16
- read syllabus papers on economics and physics

1/26/16
- ch 1-2.6 lunenburger

1/28
- ch 2.7-2.11

2/1
- ch 2.12 - 2.15, skimmed chapter 3, generally did not understand anything
- reviewed week 2 slides
- implement kaczmarz
- thought about trying to use kaczmarz in network research, didn't get very far

2/2
- ch 1-2.2.4 of Boyd and Vandenberghe
- reread ch 2-2.4 of lunenburger, worked out examples, did problems 2.1-2.5

2/3
- lunenburger 2.5 - 2.13, went slowly, followed the proofs, and did most of the things "left to the reader"
- problems 2.6 - 2.9, attempted 2.10
- reviewed bounded sets
- reviewed week two and three slides. things I don't understands
  - anything related to ML, funkytown matrices
  - minkowski functional
  - bregman divergance
  - why bother with subdifferentials when you have the hyperplane thingys from BV
  - proximal mapping
  - conjugate functions

2/4
- lunenburger 3-3.4, went slowly and did proofs, problems 3.1-3.2

2/7:
- quiz
  - need to review conjugate functions

2/8:
- read "an improved hop-by-hop interest shaper for congestion control", looked at optimization in paper

2/10
- worked problems 2.1-2.9 in BV

2/11
- 5.1 lunenburger

2/12
- 5.1-5.5 lunenburger

2/15
- implemented line search for Ax=b
- intuition for line search, conjugate gradient by reading the agonizing pain thing

2/16
- 6.1-6.3 BV

2/17
- 5.1-5.8 BV, problem 5.1

2/18-3/4 - I forgot to keep a journal of the things I did, but here are some highlights:
- Worked on formulating an optimization problem for Neko Atsume, Cat Collector
- Learned about Lyapunov stability, Lipschitzness, linearizing for stability
- Started analysis of multipath tcp optimization for utility functions of multiple variables
- Read up on descent methods
- Read up on operators
- Met up with folks outside of class
- Did midterm
- Read through the original paper on online optimization

3/5-3/7
- midterm
